            <hr>
            <p>Hello, and welcome to Melbourne // Naarm Gigs!</p>
            <p>Have you ever found yourself looking for something to do on a weekend evening, but weren't quite sure where to start? Have you ever missed a band you really wanted to see because you didn't know they were in town? Or, just as frustratingly, tickets were sold out by the time you realised they'd be playing?</p>
            <p>You're not alone - I've been there too. In fact, I got so darn diddly sick of it that I built this website to give live music FOMO the old left-right-goodnight.</p>
            <p>While other live music hubs exist, I also wanted to make it easier for gig-goers to discover new music they might not have considered otherwise - Spotify links are displayed where an active artist is detected. As a result, your experience of this app will be best if you are logged into Spotify on your current device <i class="fab fa-spotify" style="color: #1DB954; font-size: 15px;"></i></p>
            <p><b>Disclaimer: </b>The artist matching an event may not always be correct - AI is used to determine the <em>most likely</em> artist given an event title. If your event is listed here and the corresponding artist/s Spotify is incorrect and you'd like to see it change, please log using the form in the <a href="{{ url_for('main.contact') }}">contact</a> page.</p>
            <p>Otherwise I hope you get value from using this, and please reach out if you have any feedback or would just like to get in touch ☺️</p>
            <p>Take care,</p>
            <p>Cal</p>
